- There will be more/less fields depending on type of posting. If it's something for money then show a price field
- Show specific location? Pull from user account?
- If we keep our own users table, how do we know when a user has changed their info in AUS?
  + should posts be anonymous like Craig's list?
  + only show user info when viewing the detail for a classified?
